                        <p>I started learning to code when I was 14 years old because I wanted to make my own video games. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing desktop and web applications.</p>

                        <p>But my best skill is actually in eating. I am the undisputed king of eating at awesome places. Restaurants, street vendors or home cooked meals they are all my favourites.</p>
